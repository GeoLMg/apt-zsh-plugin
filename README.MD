# APT plugin for zsh

A small plugin for distros with apt package manager. It will ask you to install command, if it not installed on system. Thats all!

## [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/redxtech/zsh-aur-install#oh-my-zsh)

Install it with your favourite zsh package manager, or clone it directly to your `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins` directory with git. Or just run:

```shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto
git clone git@github.com:GeoLMg/apt-zsh-plugin.git $ZSH/plugins/apt
```

Add `zsh-aur-install` to the plugins array in your `.zshrc` file:

```shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto
plugins=(... zsh-aur-install)
```
